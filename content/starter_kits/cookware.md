# As basic as it gets
- [ ] wooden spatula
	- doesn't damage metal pan, won't melt, and won't conduct heat
- [ ] rubber spatula
- [ ] tongs
- [ ] sturdy all-purpose cutting knife
	- want it a little heavier so you have something to grab on
	- the heavier it is, the better you can leverage gravity when you're using it
- [ ] small paring knife for the details
	- cutting fruit, getting the eyes out of the potato
	- peeling things
- [ ] knife sharpener
	- something simple like dollarama is more than enough
- [ ] frying pan
	- conducts heat well so you can get a good crust on whatever you're frying
	- any material works (cast-iron, stainless steel, teflon, etc.)
	- teflon is good if you like cooking eggs so it won't stick
- [ ] sauce pan
	- anything for boiling stuff
	- make sure it has a lid!
- [ ] cutting board
	- should have some weight to it so it won't slip when you cut
# A little fancier
- [ ] cast-iron pan
- [ ] dutch oven
- [ ] rice cooker
- [ ] insta pot/pressure cooker
