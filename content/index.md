title: ðŸ›  welcome to my crude cookbook
---
It's called a crude cookbook partially because it's alliterative but also because I'm trying to make this as effortless to navigate as possible. Also, to cut through the instagram-tiktok cooking bullshit that makes you feel like that you need an industrial grade, michelin star level of a kitchen to make food that has any hint of flavour.

I hope you like it, I'm still working on the website itself, mostly just typing up the different recipes I've been working on. 

Also, almost none of my recipes have measurements on them because cooking isn't "for real, for real", the same way that baking is "for real, for real", so you might have to just add ingredients based on "feels".
