# Ingredients
- [ ] flour
- [ ] warm water
- [ ] salt
- [ ] yeast
- [ ] rosemary
- [ ] thyme
- [ ] garlic
- [ ] olive oil
- [ ] peppercorns
- [ ] chili peppers
- [ ] honey
# Procedures
1. Mix flour and water at an 80% hydration level (ex. for every 100g flour, add 80mL water)
2. Add a small pinch of salt and about twice as much yeast (there's a cookbook for it somewhere)
3. Bulk ferment at room temperature for 4 hours, fold occasionally
4. Lay out the dough and dimple it in the tray you intend to bake it in, and let it proof, covered, for ~2 hours
5. Crush all your garlic with the side of your knife
6. Heat a respectable amount of olive oil to low-medium heat and drop all of the crushed garlic
7. Preheat the oven to 400F
8. Add rosemary, thyme, peppercorns, and chili peppers to the oil and let it simmer for ~20 minutes
9. Strain the oil and let it cool
10. Pour the oil onto the dough and dimple it GENTLY to help the oil soak in
11. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown
12. Brush with a thin layer of honey, if you're an animal like me
# Notes
* If you're cold fermenting, let it sit overnight (~10 hours) and let it return to room temperature before you work with it later
* Longer bulk fermentation doesn't always mean it's good, you can overferment things. You'll know if you've overfermented if you take the cover off the dough and it smells like beer (that's the yeast doing its magic!)
* Olive oil has a low smoke point! Don't heat it too high or else it'll taste burnt
